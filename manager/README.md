# MTL Manager Documentation

## Overview

![MTL Manager Design](manager_design.svg)

MTL Manager is a daemon server designed to operate with root privileges. Its primary role is to manage the lifecycle and configurations of MTL instances. It addresses a variety of administrative tasks, including:

- Lcore Management: Ensures that MTL instances are aware of the lcores used by others, optimizing resource allocation.
- eBPF/XDP Loader: Dynamically loads and manages eBPF/XDP programs for advanced packet processing and performance tuning.
- NIC Configuration: Configures Network Interface Cards (NICs) with capabilities like adding or deleting flow and queue settings.
- Instances Monitor: Continuously monitors MTL instances, providing status reporting and clearing mechanisms.

## Build

To build with XDP support, install the dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make m4 clang llvm zlib1g-dev libelf-dev libpcap-dev libcap-ng-dev gcc-multilib
```

To compile and install the MTL Manager, use the following commands:

```bash
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
sudo meson install -C build
```

Besides MTL Manager, it will also install a built-in XDP program for udp port filtering.

## Run

To run the MTL Manager, execute:

```bash
sudo MtlManager
```

This command will start the MTL Manager with root privileges, which are necessary for the advanced eBPF and network configurations and management tasks it performs.

The XDP program for udp port filtering will be loaded along with the libxdp's built-in xsk program when the AF_XDP socket is created. It utilizes the xdp-dispatcher program provided by libxdp which allows running of multiple XDP programs in chain on the same interface. You can check the loaded programs with xdp-loader:

```text
sudo xdp-loader status
```
```text

## Run in a Docker container

Please note that the Dockerfile provided is intended for development use only. It has been tested for functionality, but not for security. Users are advised to review and modify it as necessary before using it in a production environment.

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg VERSION=$(cat ../VERSION) -t mtl-manager:latest .
# docker build --build-arg VERSION=$(cat ../VERSION) -t mtl-manager:latest --build-arg HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy --build-arg HTTPS_PROXY=$https_proxy .
```

Run the Docker container as a daemon:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mtl-manager \
  --privileged --net=host \
  -v /var/run/imtl:/var/run/imtl \
  -v /sys/fs/bpf:/sys/fs/bpf \
  mtl-manager:latest
```

Print the MTL Manager logs:

```bash
docker logs -f mtl-manager
```

Shutdown the Docker container with SIGINT:

```bash
docker kill -s SIGINT mtl-manager
# docker rm mtl-manager
```
