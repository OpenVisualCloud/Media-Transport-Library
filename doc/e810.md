# E810 driver guide

NIC setup steps for Intel速 E810 Series Ethernet Adapter

## 1. Update driver to 1.11.14 with Intel速 Media Transport Library patches

Intel速 Media Transport Library rely on some rate limit patches which are not included in the E810 driver now, we has to apply the patches by manual.

Note: Sometimes after a reboot, the operating system may upgrade to a new kernel version. Please remember to rebuild the driver if kernel version changed.

### 1.1 Download driver version with 1.11.14

Download CVL 1.11.14 driver source code from Intel website: <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19630/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-e810-series-devices-under-linux.html>. Remember to select 1.11.14 version in case it may has a newer version, 1.11.14 is the latest version we verified. Basically we revisit the driver version upgrade as quarterly schedule.

### 1.2 Unzip 1.11.14 driver and enter into the source code directory

```bash
tar xvzf ice-1.11.14.tar.gz
cd ice-1.11.14/src/
```

### 1.3 Patch 1.11.14 driver with rate limit patches

Apply the all patches under [ice_driver](../patches/ice_drv/1.11.14/)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init version 1.11.14"
git am $MTL_CODE_TREE/patches/ice_drv/1.11.14/*.patch
```

Note: $MTL_CODE_TREE should be point to the top tree of Intel速 Media Transport Library source code, and please check the git am is running without any error.

Use "git log" to check if the latest commit is d3466f825fe494bbe7809ef543ac81b337d8e5bc.

```bash
git log
commit d3466f825fe494bbe7809ef543ac81b337d8e5bc (HEAD -> master)
Author: Frank Du <frank.du@intel.com>
Date:   Fri May 5 10:03:24 2023 +0800

    version: update to kahawai 1.11.14
```

### 1.4 Build and install the driver

Pls refer to below command for build and install.

```bash
cd src
make
sudo make install
sudo rmmod ice
sudo modprobe ice
```

### 1.5 Verify both the driver and DDP version

Double check the driver version is right from dmesg.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep "Intel(R) Ethernet Connection E800 Series Linux Driver"
```

```bash
[1632263.337924] ice: Intel(R) Ethernet Connection E800 Series Linux Driver - version Kahawai_1.11.14_20230505
```

Double check the DDP version is right from dmesg.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep "The DDP package was successfully loaded"
```

```bash
The DDP package was successfully loaded: ICE OS Default Package (mc) version 1.3.30.0
```

If version is not large than 1.3.30.0, update with below commands. The DDP package can be found at the "ddp/ice-1.3.30.0.pkg" under the driver source code top tree.

```bash
cd /usr/lib/firmware/updates/intel/ice/ddp
sudo cp <latest_ddp_dir>/ice-1.3.30.0.pkg ./
sudo rm ice.pkg
sudo ln -s ice-1.3.30.0.pkg ice.pkg
sudo rmmod ice
sudo modprobe ice
```

## 2 Update firmware-version to latest

One time setup, skip this if you already did this for one Ethernet card.

### 2.1 Get the latest Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack

Download from <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/22283/Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack>

### 2.2 Unzip E810 NVMUpdatePackage

Note: change the below version number if there's a new Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack release

```bash
unzip Release_28.1.1.zip
cd NVMUpdatePackage/E810
tar xvf E810_NVMUpdatePackage_v4_20_Linux.tar.gz
cd E810/Linux_x64/
```

### 2.3 Run nvmupdate64e

Follow the instruction guide in nvmupdate64e tools, and run the upgrade if the update available.

```bash
sudo ./nvmupdate64e
```

### 2.4 Verify firmware-version

Use ethtool to verify firmware-version, change the interface name of E810 card as your setup.

```bash
ethtool -i enp175s0f0
```

A correct setup should has output like below:

```bash
driver: ice
version: Kahawai_1.11.14_20230505
firmware-version: 4.20 0x80017785 1.3346.0
expansion-rom-version:
bus-info: 0000:af:00.0
supports-statistics: yes
supports-test: yes
supports-eeprom-access: yes
supports-register-dump: yes
supports-priv-flags: yes
```
