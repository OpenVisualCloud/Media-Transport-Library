# E810 driver guide

NIC setup steps for Intel® E810 Series Ethernet Adapter

## 1. Update driver to 1.11.14 with Intel® Media Transport Library patches

The Intel® Media Transport Library relies on certain rate limit patches that are currently not included in the E810 driver. These patches need to be applied to the driver before rebuilding it.

Note: Occasionally, after a system reboot, the operating system may automatically upgrade to a new kernel version. In such cases, it is important to remember to rebuild the driver to ensure compatibility with the new kernel version.

### 1.1 Download driver version with 1.11.14

To download the CVL 1.11.14 driver source code, please visit the Intel website at <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19630/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-e810-series-devices-under-linux.html>. Make sure to select the 1.11.14 version from the available options, as there may be newer versions available. It is important to note that version 1.11.14 is the latest version we have verified. Typically, we revisit driver version upgrades on a quarterly schedule.

The steps are based on downloading file ice-1.11.14.tar.gz

### 1.2 Unzip 1.11.14 driver and enter into the source code directory

```bash
tar xvzf ice-1.11.14.tar.gz
cd ice-1.11.14/src/
```

### 1.3 Patch 1.11.14 driver with rate limit patches

Apply the all patches under [ice_driver](../patches/ice_drv/1.11.14/)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init version 1.11.14"
git am $imtl_source_code/patches/ice_drv/1.11.14/*.patch
```

Note: The variable $imtl_source_code should be set to the top directory of the Intel® Media Transport Library source code. Please ensure that it is correctly configured. Additionally, when running the "git am" command, please verify that it executes without any errors.

Use "git log" to check if the latest commit is d3466f825fe494bbe7809ef543ac81b337d8e5bc.

```bash
git log
commit d3466f825fe494bbe7809ef543ac81b337d8e5bc (HEAD -> master)
Author: Frank Du <frank.du@intel.com>
Date:   Fri May 5 10:03:24 2023 +0800

    version: update to kahawai 1.11.14
```

### 1.4 Build and install the driver

Pls refer to below command for build and install.

```bash
cd src
make
sudo make install
sudo rmmod ice
sudo modprobe ice
```

### 1.5 Verify both the driver and DDP version

Please double-check the driver version by running the "dmesg" command. This will provide you with the necessary information to confirm the correct driver version.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep "Intel(R) Ethernet Connection E800 Series Linux Driver"
```

```bash
[1632263.337924] ice: Intel(R) Ethernet Connection E800 Series Linux Driver - version Kahawai_1.11.14_20230505
```

Similar steps to confirm the DDP version.

```bash
sudo dmesg | grep "The DDP package was successfully loaded"
```

```bash
The DDP package was successfully loaded: ICE OS Default Package (mc) version 1.3.30.0
```

If version is less than 1.3.30.0, please update it using the following commands. The DDP package can be found at "ddp/ice-1.3.30.0.pkg" within the top directory of the driver source code.

```bash
cd /usr/lib/firmware/updates/intel/ice/ddp
sudo cp <latest_ddp_dir>/ice-1.3.30.0.pkg ./
sudo rm ice.pkg
sudo ln -s ice-1.3.30.0.pkg ice.pkg
sudo rmmod ice
sudo modprobe ice
```

## 2 Update firmware-version to latest

This step is a one-time setup and can be skipped if you have already completed it for one Ethernet card.

### 2.1 Get the latest Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack

Download from <https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/22283/Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack>

### 2.2 Unzip E810 NVMUpdatePackage

Note: change the below version number if there's a new Intel-Ethernet-Adapter-CompleteDriver-Pack release, the steps are based on 28.1.1 version.

```bash
unzip Release_28.1.1.zip
cd NVMUpdatePackage/E810
tar xvf E810_NVMUpdatePackage_v4_20_Linux.tar.gz
cd E810/Linux_x64/
```

### 2.3 Run nvmupdate64e

Please follow the instructions provided in the nvmupdate64e tools guide. If an update is available, proceed with running the upgrade process as outlined in the nvmupdate64e tools.

```bash
sudo ./nvmupdate64e
```

### 2.4 Verify firmware-version

To verify the firmware version, you can use the ethtool command with the interface name of your E810 card. Please replace "enp175s0f0" with the actual interface name in your setup.

```bash
ethtool -i enp175s0f0
```

A correct setup should have an output similar to the following:

```bash
driver: ice
version: Kahawai_1.11.14_20230505
firmware-version: 4.20 0x80017785 1.3346.0
expansion-rom-version:
bus-info: 0000:af:00.0
supports-statistics: yes
supports-test: yes
supports-eeprom-access: yes
supports-register-dump: yes
supports-priv-flags: yes
```
