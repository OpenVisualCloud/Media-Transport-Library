# Introduction

Starting from version 23.04, the Intel® Media Transport Library provides an efficient user-space UDP stack that is POSIX-compatible, enabling users to adopt it without any changes to their code logic. The stack features an LD preload layer that intercepts UDP socket API calls and replaces them with our implementation, allowing for deployment without code changes or the need for rebuilding.

In the Intel® Media Transport Library, data plane traffic is handled directly within the socket API under the current thread context, resulting in extremely high performance and low latency. Other user-space UDP stacks typically use a client-service architecture, which introduces cross-core message costs that can negatively impact performance and add extra latency.

Another major benefit of the Intel® Media Transport Library is data affinity, where the LLC is kept between the call and UDP stack as they share both the CPU and data context.

## 1. LibOS design

LibOS is commonly used in cloud computing environments, where it provides a lightweight and efficient platform for running containers and microservices. The Intel® Media Transport Library provides UDP protocol support to replace the kernel network stack, offering a lightweight and modular approach to building and running UDP-based applications.

This approach offers greater flexibility and efficiency, as applications can be customized to include the required functionality and can be run on a variety of platforms without the need for significant modifications.

## 2. LD preload

LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems to specify additional shared libraries to be loaded before the standard system libraries. This allows users to override or extend the functionality of existing libraries without modifying the original source code.

The Intel® Media Transport Library has an LD preload layer to intercept many network APIs, and the implementation can be found in the [UDP libos code](../lib/src/udp/).

### 2.1. Interception of UDP APIs

Note that only SOCK_DGRAM streams will be intercepted and directed to the LibOS UDP stack, while other streams like TCP will fallback to the OS path. The detailed code can be found at [ld preload code](../ld_preload/udp/).

### 2.2. Usage

Customize the so path based on your setup, as the installation path may vary across different operating systems. The MUFD_CFG environment variable points to the configuration file, which includes the PCIE DPDK BDF port, IP address, queue numbers, and other options. See 2.3. MUFD_CFG for detail.

```bash
MUFD_CFG=app/udp/ufd_server.json LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmtl_udp_preload.so program-to-run
```

### 2.3. MUFD_CFG configuration

The json file define all the required info for port instance detail. Example json can be found at [sample](../app/udp/ufd_server.json).

#### 2.3.1 interfaces

List the interface that can be used

​ **name (string):** PF/VF pci name, for example: 0000:af:01.0

​ **proto (string):** `"static", "dhcp"` interface network protocol, if DHCP is used, below ip/netmask/gateway will be ignored

​ **ip (string):** interface assigned IP, for example: 192.168.100.1

​ **netmask (string):** interface netmask(optional), for example: 255.255.254.0

​ **gateway (string):** interface gateway(optional), for example: 172.16.10.1, use "route -n" to check the gateway address before binding port to DPDK PMD.

#### 2.3.2 others

 **nb_udp_sockets (int):** The max number of socket sessions supported.

 **nb_nic_queues (int):** The max number of tx and rx queues for NIC.

 **nb_tx_desc (int):** The descriptor number for each NIC tx queue.

 **nb_rx_desc (int):** The descriptor number for each NIC rx queue.

 **log_level (int):** The log level, possible values: debug, info, notice, warning, error.

 **rx_poll_sleep_us (int):** The sleep time(us) in the rx routine to check if there's a available packet in the queue, default: 0.
