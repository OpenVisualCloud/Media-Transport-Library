## 3. Steps for netuio driver

### 3.1 Use devcon install netuio driver

Get devcon.exe from Windows WDK package, copy the devcon.exe to your netuio driver folder
execute command:

```bash
devcon.exe update netuio.inf "PCI\VEN_8086&DEV_1592"
```

### 3.2 Manually install netuio driver

* Go to Device Manager -> Network Adapters.
* Right Click on target e810 network adapter -> Select Update Driver.
* Select "Browse my computer for driver software".
* In the resultant window, select "Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer".
* Select "DPDK netUIO for Network Adapter" from the list of drivers.
* The NetUIO.sys driver is successfully installed.

## 4. NIC setup

### 4.1 Update NIC FW and driver to latest version

Refer to <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html>

### 4.2 Update the ICE DDP package file: ice.pkg

Get the latest ddp file(ice-1.3.30.0.pkg) from <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19630/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-e810-series-devices-under-linux.html>, unzip the driver and goto ddp directory.  
Windows ICE driver will try to search DDP with path "c:\dpdk\lib\ice.pkg" or ".\ice.pkg", please put the latest ddp file there and rename to ice.pkg, otherwise it will see below error if you run the RxTxApp.

```bash
ice_load_pkg(): failed to search file path
ice_dev_init(): Failed to load the DDP package, Use safe-mode-support=1 to enter Safe Mode
```

### 4.3 Create the temp folder in root directory c:\temp

## 5. Windows TAP support enable

### 5.1 Download openVPN driver by searching "OpenVPN-2.5.6-I601-amd64.msi" and download the installation file

### 5.2 Install windows TAP driver

In the Control Panel->Network and internet->Network Connections, find the "OpenVPN TAP-Windows6" device, set the adaptor IP address, such as 192.168.2.2

### 5.3 Rebuild and install MTL lib with "-Denable_tap=true"

```bash
meson tap_build --prefix=c:\libmtl -Ddpdk_root_dir=${DPDK_SRC_DIR} -Denable_tap=true
ninja -C tap_build install
```

### 5.4 Run rxtxapp.exe

Ping 192.168.2.2 from other machine in the same network such as 192.168.2.3, if have reply, the TAP works.

## 6. Run and test

You can bind the app to the cpu socket 0 ( if your NIC is inserted into the pcie slot belongs to cpu socket 0 )as following:
To identify the socket if you do not know it, in the NIC card driver property page, check the bus number, if the number is great than
0x80, then socket 1, else socket 0, for example

```bash
start /Node 0 /B .\build\app\RxTxApp --config_file config\test_tx_1port_1v.json
```

Pls refer to section 3, 4, 5 in [linux run guide](run.md) for how to run the sample application, windows share same codebase with linux, the app/lib behavior is same.
